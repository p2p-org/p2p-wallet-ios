# How to use BECollectionView
About `BECollectionView`:

- Creating `ListView` (`UITableView`, `UICollectionView`) in `UIKit` is a painful task which requires a lot of efforts. You firstly has to layout the `ListView`, create `Cell`, register it, bind data to data source and set up delegate. This type of actions is tedious and have to be repeated time to time.

- Plus, in this application we don't use UITableView at all, as its layout is not good for iPhone in landscape mode, and again, it requires a lot of efforts. So I provide a solution named `BECollectionView` (with an embeded UICollectionView) that you can use easily without digging into UIKit's tableView's implementation and get rid of setting dataSource, delegate, registerCell, binding, ... by yourself. You can use it in a replacement for `UITableView` and `UICollectionView`.

- `BECollectionView` was born with the aim is to simplify the process of creating `ListView` by hiding the detail of `UIKit` `ListView`'s implemetation as much as posible, so you can concentrate on bussiness logic. After a few configurations, you got features like Pull to refresh, loading animation, add, remove, replace cells animation,... for free. The only thing that you need to care about is the flow of data.

Bellow is an example of implementing `BECollectionView`, with example from this [task](https://p2pvalidator.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/P2PW/boards/20?label=iOS&selectedIssue=P2PW-985)

## Create a Model T
Assume that we have to create a collection of recipients, create a struct named `Recipient` to represent a record and conform it to `Hashable`:
```swift
struct Recipient: Hashable {
    let address: String
    let shortAddress: String
    let name: String?
}
```

## Create a ListViewModel that inheritted from BEListViewModel<T>
This class is clearly a `ViewModel` that is responsible for data flow in `BECollectionView`. All these `ViewModel` has to be a subclass of `BEListViewModel<T>`. The only method that you need to inherit right now is `createRequest`:

```swift
import RxSwift
import BECollectionView

class RecipientsListViewModel: BEListViewModel<Recipient> {
    // MARK: - Dependencies
    @Injected private var nameService: NameServiceType
    @Injected private var addressFormatter: AddressFormatterType
    
    // MARK: - Properties
    var name: String = ""
    
    // MARK: - Methods
    /// The only methods that MUST be inheritted
    override func createRequest() -> Single<[Recipient]> {
        guard !name.isEmpty else {return .just([])}
        return nameService
            .getOwners(name)
            .map { [weak addressFormatter] in
                guard let addressFormatter = addressFormatter else { return [] }

                return $0.map {
                    Recipient(
                        address: $0.owner,
                        shortAddress: addressFormatter.shortAddress(of: $0.owner),
                        name: $0.name
                    )
                }
            }
    }
}
```

## Create a UICollectionViewCell that conform to BECollectionViewCell
No need to explain, this class is required to have `setUp(with:)` to handling data presentation, `hideLoading()` and `showLoading()` for handling loading state.

```swift
class RecipientCell: UICollectionViewCell, BECollectionViewCell {
    private let recipientView = RecipientView()
    
    ...
    
    // MARK: - BECollectionViewCell implementation
    func setUp(with item: AnyHashable?) {
        guard let recipient = item as? Recipient else {return}
        recipientView.setRecipient(recipient)
    }
    
    func hideLoading() {
        recipientView.hideLoader()
    }
    
    func showLoading() {
        recipientView.showLoader()
    }
}
```

## (Optional) Header, Footer section
Example of creating Header, Footer view (as `UICollectionReusableView`s)
```swift
extension SelectRecipient {
    final class SectionHeaderView: UICollectionReusableView {
        private let titleLabel = UILabel(textSize: 15, weight: .medium, textColor: .a3a5ba)
        
        ...

        private func addSubviews() {
            [titleLabel].forEach(addSubview)
        }

        private func setConstraints() {
            ...
        }
    }
}
```

## Create instance of `BECollectionView` or subclass it
There are 2 types of `BECollectionView`: `BEStaticSectionsCollectionView` and `BEDynamicSectionsCollectionView`. But you can concentrate on just `BEStaticSectionsCollectionView` right now, `BEDynamicSectionsCollectionView` will be explained later (Example: `TransactionsCollectionView`)

Now you have anything you need for a section in collection view: section header, footer (optional), cells and viewModel (for handling data flow), now you can construct a section:

```swift
let section: BEStaticSectionsCollectionView.Section = .init(
    index: 0,
    layout: .init(
        header: .init(viewClass: SectionHeaderView.self, heightDimension: .absolute(76)),
        cellType: RecipientCell.self,
        numberOfLoadingCells: 2
    ),
    viewModel: recipientsListViewModel
)
```

After that you can create an instance of `BEStaticSectionsCollectionView` or subclass it (but i recommend you to subclass it for easily modifying header, footer in section):

```swift
import BECollectionView

extension SelectRecipient {
    final class RecipientsCollectionView: BEStaticSectionsCollectionView {
        // MARK: - Dependencies
        private let recipientsListViewModel: RecipientsListViewModel
        
        // MARK: - Initializer
        init(recipientsListViewModel: RecipientsListViewModel) {
            self.recipientsListViewModel = recipientsListViewModel
            
            let section: BEStaticSectionsCollectionView.Section = .init(...)
            
            super.init(
                header: nil,
                sections: [section],
                footer: nil
            )
        }
        
        // MARK: -
        
        /// Do anything after a snapshot of data has been loaded (update header for example)
        override func dataDidLoad() {
            super.dataDidLoad()
//            let header = sectionHeaderView(sectionIndex: 0) as? SectionHeaderView {
//                // do something with header
//            }
        }
    }
}

```

## Controll data flow
After adding `RecipientsCollectionView`, and setting up `RecipientsListViewModel`, you can controll it's data flow by injecting data and calling method `reload()` on listViewModel like this:

```swift
recipientSearchSubject
    .subscribe(
        onNext: { [weak self] searchText in
            self?.recipientsListViewModel.name = searchText
            self?.recipientsListViewModel.reload()
        }
    )
    .disposed(by: disposeBag)
```

## What you got after doing this?
- Pull to refresh by default (can be turned off)
- Loading cell shown when data is loading
- 2 columns in landscape mode

## Disclaimer
- I know that `UIKit` is dying and being replaced by `SwiftUI`. `SwiftUI` has very clarify way to define `ListView` with lack of efforts, but it is right now unstable for iOS13, so I think `BECollectionView` is a good solution right now for easily implementing `ListView` in `UIKit` for iOS earlier than iOS15.
- This lib is in early state of developing, API may be changed frequently.
- If you have any idea, please constribute.
