If the network is changed to %@, the address field must be filled in with a %@.
If the token is changed to %@, the address field must be filled in with a %@.
If there is a token named “%@“, we don't recommend sending it to your Solana address since it will most likely be lost forever.
If you cannot complete this transaction within the required time, please return at a later date.
If you create a new wallet account, you will receive your security key that you must write down somewhere safe. This is the only way to recover your wallet.\n\nIf you still have access to your old wallet, sometimes you can recover your security key from it.\n\nUsing Custodian wallet, you still have the option to regain access to your data by asking a third party.
If you do not finish your transaction within this period/session/time frame, you risk losing the deposits.
If you have no backup, you may never be able to access this account.
If you lose this device, you can recover your encrypted wallet backup from iCloud
If you lose this device, you can recover your encrypted wallet by using iCloud or mannually inputing your secret phrases
